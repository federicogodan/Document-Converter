Libreoffice multiple instances  
==============================

The following steps describe the installation of Libreoffice multiple instances on the same machine.

1 - RPM installation
   -----------------

It is necessary to have an rpm or deb file for installation.
These steps will be explained for rpm format. If you want to use another format,
you can look at the link above, which specifies the steps to be followed to continue 
using the other format.

The rpm could be downloaded from the following url: http://www.libreoffice.org/download/
You should pay attention as to the correct version of rpm, depending on the CPU architecture.
The CPU architecture could be known using one of the following command: uname-m or uname-a


2 - Create an instance
   -------------------

2.1 
Unpack tar file : tar -vxzf 'file', where 'file' is the downloaded rpm.

2.2 

* Move to the folder RPMS inside the creadted directory.

* Create a new directory : mkdir install

* Move to that directory : cd install

* Install rpm2cpio : sudo apt-get install rpm2cpio

* Create a copy from all rpms : for i in ../*.rpm; do rpm2cpio $i | cpio -id; done

* Edit the file 'bootstraprc', where the variable 'UserInstallation' must be filled with 
different values for different instances.
In this example, the field is completed with the value '$SYSUSERCONFIG/.libreoffice/4' 

vim opt/libreoffice4.1/program/bootstraprc

UserInstallation=$SYSUSERCONFIG/.libreoffice/4

3 - Create another instance 
    -----------------------
Above steps must be followed but this time, creating another folder into the unzipped folder.

* Create another directory, for example with the name 'install2' : mkdir install2

* Move to that directory : cd install2

* Copy rmp files to that directory : for i in ../RPMS/*.rpm; do rpm2cpio $i | cpio -id; done

* Edit the file 'bootstraprc', with another name. 
In this example, the variable takes the value '$SYSUSERCONFIG/.libreoffice/3' changing the value from 4 to 3.

vim opt/libreoffice4.1/program/bootstraprc
UserInstallation=$SYSUSERCONFIG/.libreoffice/3

4- Observations
  -------------
If you want to add more instances, you must continue repeating the steps explained before, 
creating folders with different names ('installX' for example), and editing the file 'bootstraprc' 
assigning different names to the variable 'UserInstallation'.

s3cmd
=====

Follow these steps to install s3cmd to use s3 repository:

1- Install s3cmd : sudo apt-get install s3cmd

2- Configure it : s3cmd --configure
There, you have to put the API access-key and the API secret-key of your bucket.

3- Get file from a bucket : s3cmd get s3://bucket/file, where 'file' is the name of the file you want to download.

4- Put that file into a s3 bucket : s3cmd put file s3://bucket , where 'file' is the name of the file you want to put
