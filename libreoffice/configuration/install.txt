libreoffice multiple instances  
==============================

The following steps describe the installation of libreoffice multiple instances on the same machine.

1 - RPM installation
   -----------------

It is necessary to have an rpm or deb file for installation.
These steps will be explained for rpm format. If you want to use another format,
can look at the link above, which specifies the steps to be followed to continue 
using the other format.

The rpm could be downloaded from the following url: http://www.libreoffice.org/download/
You should pay attention as to the correct version of rpm, depending on the CPU architecture.
The CPU architecture could be knowed using one of the following command: uname-m or uname-a


2 - Create an instance
   -------------------

2.1 
unpack tar file : tar -vxzf 'archivo'
Donde 'archivo' es el rpm bajado.

2.2 

* Move to the folder RPMS inside de directory created.

* create a new directory : mkdir install

* move to that directory : cd install

* install rpm2cpio : sudo apt-get install rpm2cpio

* create a copy from all rpms : for i in ../*.rpm; do rpm2cpio $i | cpio -id; done

* Edit the file 'bootstraprc', where the variable 'UserInstallation' must be fill with 
different values to different instances.
In this example, the field is completed with the value '$SYSUSERCONFIG/.libreoffice/4' 

vim opt/libreoffice4.1/program/bootstraprc

UserInstallation=$SYSUSERCONFIG/.libreoffice/4

3 - Create another instance 
    -----------------------
Above steps are followed but creating another folder into the folder you unzipped.

* Create another directory, for example with the name 'install2' : mkdir install2

* Move to that directory : cd install2

* Copy rmp files to that directory : for i in ../RPMS/*.rpm; do rpm2cpio $i | cpio -id; done

* Edit the file 'bootstraprc', with another name. 
At this example, the variable takes the value '$SYSUSERCONFIG/.libreoffice/3' changin the value 4 to 3.

vim opt/libreoffice4.1/program/bootstraprc
UserInstallation=$SYSUSERCONFIG/.libreoffice/3

4- Observations
  -------------
If you want to add more instances, must be continue repeating the steps before explained, 
creating folders with different names ('installX' for example), and editing the file 'bootstraprc' 
assigning different names to the variable 'UserInstallation'.
